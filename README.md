# Vanilla RPG 2

## Introduction

Vanilla RPG 2 is an expanded and improved version of the role-playing game created in the FreeCodeCamp tutorial "Learn Basic JavaScript by Building a Role Playing Game". This project takes the original concept and enhances it with TypeScript implementation, improved code structure, and an enhanced user interface.

## Project Overview

The game is a text-based RPG where players can explore different locations, fight monsters, buy weapons and health, and engage in various activities. The core mechanics include:

- Player stats (XP, Health, Gold)
- Inventory management
- Combat system
- Multiple locations (Town Square, Store, Cave)
- Various monsters to fight

## Code Structure

The project is written in TypeScript, providing better type safety and code organization. Key aspects of the code structure include:

- Clear interfaces for game elements (Weapon, Monster, Location)
- Modular functions for different game actions
- TypeScript type checking for DOM elements and game state
- Improved code documentation with JSDoc comments

## Planned Enhancements

While the current version already expands on the original tutorial, there are plans to further develop the game with features such as:

1. Player leveling system with increasing stats
2. Enhanced inventory management
3. Additional monsters and enemy types
4. More complex combat system
5. Expanded world with more NPCs, quests, and locations

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
